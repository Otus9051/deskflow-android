The only potential configuration change required by the Deskflow Android client, 
is the TLS configuration, described below.

#### Setup Connection

The only configuration information required is:

- `Screen Name` the name you configured in the Deskflow Server.
- `Host` & `Port` of your Deskflow Server.
- `Use TLS` if your Deskflow Server is configured for TLS.

Press `Save` to save your configuration and return to the home screen.

> NOTE: As soon as you press `Save`, the app will attempt to connect to the Deskflow Server.

#### Keyboard (IME) 

> IMPORTANT: The Deskflow Android IME, **When Connected to a Deskflow Server**, will always attempt to force the `Deskflow Android Keyboard` ensuring seamless work between Deskflow Server & Client.
> In the case you don't want to use the Deskflow Android Keyboard, you can stop the connection to the Deskflow Server using the button in the top right corner of the app.

The Deskflow Android IME (Input Method Editor) is a custom keyboard that will show the current connection status and will look 
like this screen shot when connected:

#### Start/Stop Connection

There is a button in the top right corner of the app to start/stop the connection to the Deskflow Server.

This is useful if you want to either use the regular soft/hard keyboard functionality or simply want to disconnect from the Deskflow Server.
